Instead, they focus on the raw data itself, making it easy to import, export, and analyze data in a standardized format.

To better understand the structure of a CSV file, here is an example of how tabular data can be represented in a CSV format:

| Name | Age | Gender |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John | 25 | Male |
| Sarah | 30 | Female |
| Michael | 35 | Male |

In this example, each row represents a person's information, with columns for their name, age, and gender. The values are separated by commas, and the table is easy to read and interpret.

### Differences between PDF and CSV

PDF and CSV are two different file formats used for storing and organizing data. While both formats are commonly used in various industries, they have distinct characteristics and purposes.

PDF (Portable Document Format) is a file format that preserves the visual appearance of a document, including its layout, fonts, and images. It is widely used for sharing documents that need to be viewed and printed exactly as they were created. PDF files are typically read-only and not easily editable.

On the other hand, CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text format used for storing tabular data. It consists of rows and columns, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. CSV files are commonly used for data exchange between different software applications, as they can be easily imported and exported.

To summarize the differences:

*   PDF is a visual document format, while CSV is a data storage format.
*   PDF preserves the visual appearance of a document, while CSV focuses on the structured representation of data.
