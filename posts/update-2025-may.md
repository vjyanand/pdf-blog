 We have released new changes to convert tables from PDF files.

---
We're excited to announce the release of our latest feature enhancement: AI-powered table recognition technology.

PDF tables can be tricky. Sometimes you only need specific tables from a document, or you're dealing with complex layouts where automatic detection falls short. Our new table selection feature lets you draw directly on PDFs to specify which tables to convert.
