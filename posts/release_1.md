 We're excited to announce the release of new changes that address a previous bug related to handling special characters in PDF tables. This bug caused certain characters, such as accents and foreign letters, to appear incorrectly when processing these tables. We've implemented updates to the text encoding method, ensuring accurate representation of all characters within PDF tables moving forward. This improvement will guarantee reliable data extraction and display for all your PDF documents.
