## The Challenge of Table Data in PDFs

PDF documents remain one of the most common formats for sharing information, but extracting structured data from them—especially tables—has long been a pain point for organizations and individuals alike. Traditional extraction methods often fail to preserve table structure, resulting in misaligned data, lost relationships between cells, and time-consuming manual corrections.

## Our AI-Powered Solution

Our new table recognition system leverages advanced deep learning models to accurately identify, extract, and preserve the structure of tables in PDF documents. The system can:

- Detect tables of varying complexity, including nested tables and those with merged cells
- Maintain the exact structure and relationships between data points
- Handle tables across multiple pages with consistent recognition
- Process tables in documents with complex layouts
- Support tables in various languages and formats
