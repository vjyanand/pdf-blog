We're excited to announce a powerful new enhancement to our PDF conversion tool: **Table Selection Drawing**. This intuitive feature lets you directly interact with your PDFs by simply drawing around the tables you want to extract—making the conversion process faster, more precise, and remarkably user-friendly.

## Draw to Extract: A New Way to Work with Tables

Converting tables from PDFs has always been challenging. Traditional extraction tools often struggle with complex layouts, merged cells, or distinguishing tables from surrounding content. Our new drawing selection tool puts you in complete control:

- **Draw directly on the PDF**: Use your cursor or stylus to draw a box around any table
- **Instant visual feedback**: See your selection highlighted in real-time
- **Fine-tune with precision**: Adjust your selection with simple drag handles

## Why We Built This Feature

We discovered that automated table detection, while convenient, isn't always perfect—especially with complex documents. Sometimes you need human judgment to identify exactly which data matters most.

By combining the power of our conversion engine with your ability to visually identify important tables, we've created a hybrid approach that delivers superior results in less time.


We'd love to hear how this new feature improves your workflow! Share your feedback with us at help@pdftableconvert.com.
